A web-based training tool for mastering the **Basic Relativity** mechanic in **[Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage)](<https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Eden%27s_Promise:_Eternity_(Savage)>)**, with a special focus on **Blue Mage** players.

## Overview

This interactive canvas-based quiz helps players practice and reinforce their understanding of the **Basic Relativity** mechanic from **E12S (Phase 2)** in _Final Fantasy XIV_. You‚Äôll be shown randomized **debuffs**, and must click on the correct position in the arena to avoid AoEs and prevent wipes.

Though tailored for **Blue Mages**, this tool is helpful for **any player** looking to review the mechanic, refresh their memory, or sharpen their positional awareness.
