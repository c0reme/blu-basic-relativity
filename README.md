A web-based training tool for mastering the **Basic Relativity** mechanic in **[Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage)](<https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Eden%27s_Promise:_Eternity_(Savage)>)**, with a special focus on **Blue Mage** players.

## Overview

This interactive canvas-based quiz helps players practice and reinforce their understanding of the **Basic Relativity** mechanic from **E12S (Phase 2)** in _Final Fantasy XIV_. You‚Äôll be shown randomized **debuffs**, and must click on the correct position in the arena to avoid AoEs and prevent wipes.

Though tailored for **Blue Mages**, this tool is helpful for **any player** looking to review the mechanic, refresh their memory, or sharpen their positional awareness.

## How to Use

1. Open the quiz: [https://c0reme.github.io/blu-basic-relativity](https://c0reme.github.io/blu-basic-relativity)
2. Review your assigned **debuffs** and check for **blue-coloured lights**, which indicate where to bait the light mechanic.
3. Click on the arena where you would position yourself during the mechanic.
4. If your answer is correct, you‚Äôll receive confirmation. If incorrect, the correct position will be highlighted so you can learn from the mistake.
5. Repeat and improve your awareness and timing!
